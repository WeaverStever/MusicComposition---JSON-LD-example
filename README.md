A (howto) framework for Schema.org MusicComposition, MusicRecording and release information

Because the song durations are different lengths, the releases were treated as separate recordings.<br>
(This allows for separate ISRC codes)

Had the song durations been the same, I would have used two releases of the same (master) recording.<br>
(TODO: Labels could concievably release the same master recording under different ISRC codes. In the current schema, currently, the only expected type for isrcCode is MusicRecording.)
